          <h3>Background</h3>
          <p><strong>Hello!</strong> My name is Hamza Ben alla, and I am a fourth-year
            international student from Morocco. I grew up in the city of Casablanca,
            whose name translates to “White House.” Although the city is now filled with
            buildings of many colors, I like to imagine there was once a single white
            house that inspired its name, this was childhood theory of mine.</p>
          <p>As a child, I shared the same passion for video games as most kids my age,
            yet I was also captivated by the inner workings of electronics, so much so
            that my relatives would often hide their phones to keep me from experimenting
            with them, fearful that I might cause damage. In truth, I never truly broke
            anything, but I might have played with their setting just a <strong>few</strong>
            times, which might sometimes resulted in minor mishaps. This fascination
            with understanding how computers and electronics function ultimately led me
            to pursue a degree in computer science.</p>

          <h3>Education</h3>
          <p>I'm a fourth-year computer science honours student at Acadia University with
            a focus on research and development in AI. Currently, my honours thesis
            investigates the early detection of Alzheimer's disease by employing a
            robust Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model for image classification,
            integrating MRI and PET scans.</p>

          <h3>Learning Objectives</h3>
          <p>In my journey in COMP 3033 Full-Stack Cloud Computing, my main goal is to
            develop a comprehensive skill set that covers both front-end and back-end
            technologies. By the end of the semester, I hope to create a fully functional
            website that showcases my skills. So, here are some of my key learning
            objectives for this course:</p>
          <!-- Bootstrap Styled list using Bootstrap's list group -->
          <ul class="list-group">

              responsive, visually appealing front-end interfaces.
            </li>
            <li class="list-group-item">
